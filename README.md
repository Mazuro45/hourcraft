# Hourcraft [Minecraft Version 1.21] 
Hourcraft is a Minecraft Adventure Map based on Cyberwave's Hourglass. The gameplay is basically the same, create a zeitgeist of yourself, interact with buttons, pressure plates and cubes, explore ancient Egyptian temples and gain new abilities that open up new places for you to explore. As a renowned archaeologist, you are called to an excavation site where some inexplicable anomalies are appearing.
